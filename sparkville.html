                          <h5>BACKGROUND</h5><br>
                          <div>Sparkville's target learner is a creative middle schooler with low to medium prior interest in STEM: often, girls 
                              and minorities. Despite progress and programming to make STEM more accessible to underserved populations, there still 
                              exists a gap. Though gender achievement in STEM topics is at parity through early high school, as girls approach 
                              college they are less likely to pursue advanced math and science classes or STEM majors than their male counterparts.
                              <br><br>
                              Current interventions like extracurricular camps or clubs have multiple barriers to entry for underserved STEM populations, 
                              including time, finances, and motivation. As a mass-market web-based game which encourages fun, applied exploration of STEAM topics, 
                              Sparkville has the potential to impact a broad target audience.
                              <br><br>
                          </div>
                          <h5>RESEARCH</h5><br>
                          <div>Early in the design process I performed research to gain a deeper understanding of
                            motivations, barriers, and best practices to encourage attitudinal change among our
                            target learners. I began by conducting stakeholder interviews with educators, educational 
                            technology designers, and middle school program leaders, as well as performing contextual inquiry with middle 
                            school girls at Carnegie Mellon's TechNights program. Research goals included discovering:
                            <br><br>
                            <ol>
                               1. What de/motivates children to engage in STEM learning?<br>
                               <br>2. How well do existing interventions meet this need? What are best practices we might draw from?<br>
                               <br>3. How do children think about careers?
                            </ol>
                            Insights I found included:<br><br>
                            <ol>
                                1. Many interventions aimed at breaking barriers to entry for underserved
                                STEM populations already require some amount of motivation and familiarity. Girls attending TechNights were STEM 
                                "power-students," either encouraged by parents in STEM careers or who discovered the program through robotics challenges.<br>
                                <br>2. Middle schoolers sought out extracurricular learning experiences due to boredom and repetition inside the classroom. <br>
                                <br>3. Middle schoolers are curious and excited to understand what it means to be a STEM professional, and are already thinking about college majors.
                             </ol><br>
                             <h5>VALIDATION THROUGH DESIGN</h5><br>
                             <video controls="" name="media"><source src="assets/sparkville.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>                                    <br> 
                          <br>
                          <span>All assets and content are original, excluding footage of CAD from 2:07-3:09. This was drawn from a public YouTube video and 
                          was used purely to convey the concept of CAD within the challenge for user testing.</span>
                          <br><br>
                          After we created a concept video for Sparkville, I arranged to perform user testing with several Pittsburgh middle schoolers. 
                          In the session students took a pre-survey, watched the concept video, took a post-survey, and participated in a followup discussion.
                        <br><br>
                        Formative assessment goals included:
                        ● Did watching the concept video of the jewelry design challenge broaden
students’ perception of STEM skills’ value to creative jobs?
● Did watching the concept video expose students to new career paths and the
skills needed?
● Did students show improved self-efficacy scores in STEAM subjects before vs.after watching the concept video?
15
● Did students exhibit curiosity and motivation to pursue STEAM subjects after
watching the concept video?
● Was the game age-appropriate and interesting?

From the session, we learned:

1. Participants were universally excited by the game. Unprompted, the girls
noted that they would pay for it.

“Is this a real game? If this is ever published I would love to get it. I would pay
money for it.”
“I would beg my mom to get it. Even if it cost money on the app store.”

Participants were particularly drawn by the ability to choose a multitude of
categories of interest before entering the game, especially ones outside of
traditional school subjects.

2. Children are purchasing and playing mobile games frequently. 

Kids want games that are age-appropriate and interesting but they need
parent approval to play them. Parents want to limit kids’ screen time and use of
non-educational games. Sparkville poses an opportunity to meet the needs of
both parties.

Participants universally agreed that a game about career exploration was
relevant, interesting, and important.

Two of four participants already had
careers in mind, one noting he wanted to follow either his mother’s career path
(doctor) or his father’s (engineer). The two participants who did not have a
career in mind - one boy and one girl - emphasized that it was important to learn
about different careers. One mentioned that Sparkville might help him explore
and take risks:
“[When playing this game] I would try out different stuff outside of my comfort
zone and see if I might like it.”
