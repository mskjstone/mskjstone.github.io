                          <h5>BACKGROUND</h5><br>
                          <div>Despite progress and programming to make STEM more accessible to underserved populations, there still 
                              exists a gap. For instance, though gender achievement in STEM topics is at parity through early high school, as girls approach 
                              college they are less likely to pursue advanced math and science classes or STEM majors than their male counterparts.
                              <br><br>
                              Current interventions like extracurricular camps or clubs have multiple barriers to entry for underserved STEM populations, 
                              including time, finances, and motivation. My project partner and I asked, how might a mass-market, web-based game change childrens'
                              attitudes, self-efficacy perceptions, and motivation to engage in STEM learning?
                              <br><br>
                          </div>
                          <h5>RESEARCH</h5><br>
                          <div>Early in the design process I performed research to gain a deeper understanding of
                            motivations, barriers, and best practices to encourage this growth among our
                            target learners. I began by conducting stakeholder interviews with educators, educational 
                            technology designers, and middle school program leaders, as well as performing contextual inquiry with middle 
                            school girls at Carnegie Mellon's TechNights program.

                                <p class="lead font-weight-bold">
                                    1. What de/motivates children to engage in STEM learning?
                                    <br>2. How well do existing interventions meet this need? What are best practices we might draw from?
                                    <br>3. How do children think about careers?

                                <p>
                                    Many interventions aimed at breaking barriers to entry for underserved
                                    STEM populations already require some amount of motivation and familiarity. Girls attending TechNights were STEM 
                                    "power-students," either encouraged by parents in STEM careers or who discovered the program through robotics challenges.<br>
                                    <br>Middle schoolers sought out extracurricular learning experiences due to boredom and repetition inside the classroom. <br>
                                    <br>Middle schoolers are curious and excited to understand what it means to be a STEM professional, and are already thinking about college majors.

                             <h5>VALIDATION THROUGH DESIGN</h5><br>
                             <video controls="" name="media"><source src="assets/sparkville.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>                                    <br>

                          <br><br>
                          After we created a concept video for Sparkville, I arranged to perform user testing with several Pittsburgh middle schoolers. 
                          In the session students took a pre-survey, watched the concept video, took a post-survey, and participated in a followup discussion.

                            <p>1. Did watching the concept video of the jewelry design challenge broaden students’ perception of STEM skills’ value to creative jobs?
                                <br>2. Did watching the concept video expose students to new career paths and the skills needed?
                                <br>3. Did students show improved self-efficacy scores in STEAM subjects before vs. after watching the concept video?
                                <br> 4. Did students exhibit curiosity and motivation to pursue STEAM subjects after watching the concept video?
                                <br> 5. Was the game age-appropriate and interesting?

                          </div>
                          <h6>FINDINGS</h6>
                          <p><h6>1. Participants were universally excited by the game. Unprompted, the girls noted that they would pay for it.</h6>
                              <br><span class="quote">“Is this a real game? If this is ever published I would love to get it. I would pay
                              money for it.”
                              <br><br>“I would beg my mom to get it. Even if it cost money on the app store.”</span>
                              <br><br>Participants were particularly drawn by the ability to choose a multitude of
                              categories of interest before entering the game, especially ones outside of
                              traditional school subjects.<br><br><br>
                            <h6>2. Children are purchasing and playing mobile games frequently.</h6><br>
                            Kids want games that are age-appropriate and interesting but they need parent approval to play them. Parents want to 
                            limit kids’ screen time and use of non-educational games. Sparkville poses an opportunity to meet the needs of both parties.<br><br><br>
                            <h6>3. Participants universally agreed that a game about career exploration was relevant, interesting, and important.</h6>
                            <br>Two of four participants already had
                            careers in mind, one noting he wanted to follow either his mother’s career path
                            (doctor) or his father’s (engineer). The two participants who did not have a
                            career in mind - one boy and one girl - emphasized that it was important to learn
                            about different careers. One mentioned that Sparkville might help him explore
                            and take risks:
                            <br><br><span class="quote">“[When playing this game] I would try out different stuff outside of my comfort
                            zone and see if I might like it.”</span><br><br><br>
                            <h6>4.  Pre- and post- survey responses did not reveal a marked increase in students’
                                assessment of the value of STEM topics to the jewelry design career, though males’ scores showed improvement in 
                                the value of art and science.</h6><br>
                            However, across both males and females, and females especially, they reported
                            higher attitudinal scores post-video related to working within the subject domains
                            shown in the challenge video. Given participants’ varying attitudinal change on the value of STEM topics to
                            the featured career, in future iterations we would explore more ways to explicitly address the role of STEM content in
                            challenges.<br><br>
